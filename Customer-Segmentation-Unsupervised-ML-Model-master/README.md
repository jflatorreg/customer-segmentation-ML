In this procject, I worked on a real-world e-commerce sales data and segmented its customer base with Python, [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/). 

The workflow of the project is as follows:

1. Business Case
2. Data Preparation
3. Segmentation with K-means Clustering
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Visualization and Interpretation of the Results

Article of the project "Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning" can be read [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/customer-segmentation-with-machine-learning-a0ac8c3d4d84?source=friends_link&sk=91a45f28699eda78766335947bed7044)!

The notebook can be viewed in the nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cereniyim/Customer-Segmentation-Unsupervised-ML-Model/blob/3c4374dd16861ea365cdf468bd9b2c28a964f4e3/Customer_Segmentation_Kmeans_Clustering.ipynb) with interactive plotly plots.
